# Air-Quality-and-Environment-Monitoring-System
An air quality (particulate matter) and environmental (Temperature,Humidity,Pressure) sensor system smart way to monitor environment is presented with different models in this project. In the proposed architecture functions of different modules were discussed. The noise and air pollution monitoring system with Internet of Things (IoT) concept experimentally tested for monitoring two parameters. It also sent the sensor parameters to the cloud. This data will be helpful for future analysis and it can be easily shared to other end users. This model can be further expanded to monitor the developing cities and industrial zones for pollution monitoring. This project is an efficient and low cost solution for continuous monitoring of environment
