# Air-Quality-and-Environment-Monitoring-System
An air quality (particulate matter) and environmental (Temperature,Humidity,Pressure) sensor system smart way to monitor environment is presented with different models in this project. In the proposed architecture functions of different modules were discussed. The noise and air pollution monitoring system with Internet of Things (IoT) concept experimentally tested for monitoring two parameters. It also sent the sensor parameters to the cloud. This data will be helpful for future analysis and it can be easily shared to other end users. This model can be further expanded to monitor the developing cities and industrial zones for pollution monitoring. This project is an efficient and low cost solution for continuous monitoring of environment 


#Results
This project can be expanded in future in many ways to serve many purpose.
A web can be created where data from cities and various countries are available. Thus, providing a single platform to monitor and
analyze air pollution at various locations. This web platform can act as a beneficial resource for making people aware of their
environments.
Along with air and noise pollution monitoring, this project can be extended to monitor water pollution also.
